# Lua
Luas for FFXI
These are all LUA for Final Fantasy XI.
To use them, save them as lua in Notepad++ with the following name (FFXI UserName)_job
So if your username is Frank and the job is Bard.. it would look like: frank_brd.lua

Also, I have picked up how to code lua from reading other people's stuff, you may even notice blurbs that are copywritten material of other people's lua.. that's probably because I copy and pasted one of their hooks. I don't pretend to be the exclusive creater of any of this content, only the Doctor of weaving it together for the use of the Final Fantasy XI community. I also don't intend to make any money off of this, so anyone concerned with any copyrighting, I do not claim to be the author of or intend to make any money from creation and distribution of these lua. That being said, none of these lua will be exactly like anyone else's, unless they copied it from here.
